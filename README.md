# Quiz Simulation and Time Calculation

This Python script simulates a quiz and calculates the time taken to complete it.

### How It Works

The `quiz.py` script:
- Welcomes the user to the quiz.
- Waits for the user to start the quiz by pressing Enter.
- Records the start time.
- Simulates five quiz questions (currently just asking "What is 2 + 2?").
- Records the end time after the quiz completes.
- Calculates and displays the total time taken to complete the quiz.

### Usage

To run the script:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run `python quiz.py`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to start and complete the quiz.

### Additional Notes

- This is a basic example and can be expanded by adding more questions and improving user interaction.
- Feel free to customize the quiz content and functionality based on your requirements.
